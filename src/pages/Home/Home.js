            Hi, Tara here üëãüèΩ <br></br> <br></br>I'm a Full Stack Developer,
            travel-enthusiast, and dog-mom extraordinaire based out of beautiful
            Victoria, BC. <br></br>
            <br></br> I‚Äôm a positive, driven and detail-oriented professional
            that has always gravitated toward roles where I got to solve the
            toughest problems while collaborating with others. I'm equal parts
            problem solver and relationship builder. Right now I'm in a fun
            chapter of my career where I'm growing my technical skillset! I have
            professional experience using React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby on
            Rails, Node.js, Express, Tailwind and Sass. <br></br>
            <br></br>I've worked in tech for seven years in Technical Solutions
            Consulting and have a degree in Business and Science so I'm equal
            parts logical problem-solver and relationship builder. I completed
            BrainStation's Software Engineering Bootcamp as well as Lighthouse
            Labs Front-end Fundamentals course. The tasks I enjoy the most are
            building interactive components in React and TypeScript and sending
            data from those components to a database or external system.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>As my current work contract is ending February 2024, I'm
            looking for work as a Software Developer.
