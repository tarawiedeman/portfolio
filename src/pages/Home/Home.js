    <p className="home__name">Hi, Tara here üëãüèΩ <br></br> <br></br>I'm a Full Stack Developer, travel-enthusiast, and dog-mom extraordinaire based out of beautiful Victoria, BC. <br></br><br></br> I recently graduated from BrainStation's full-stack software development diploma program, where I strengthened my skills in Javascript, TypeScript, React, SQL, Node, Express and many others. I am most comfortable working with React JS as a front-end framework and NodeJS and ExpressJS as back-end frameworks but have a breadth of other knowledge and a curious mind!<br></br><br></br> I've worked in tech for seven years in Technical Solutions Consulting and have a degree in Business and Science so I'm equal parts logical problem-solver and relationship builder. The tasks I enjoy the most are problem-solving, building API requests or request handling, and troubleshooting complex systems.<br></br><br></br>I'm currently searching for a position as a Software Developer. </p>
