          <p>Hi, Tara here üëãüèΩ</p>
          <p>
            I'm a technical solutions consultant and developer that's passionate
            about exploring the endless potential of technology in adding
            *value* to our lives. I'm also a travel enthusiast and dog-mom
            extraordinaire based out of beautiful Victoria, BC.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm a positive, driven and detail-oriented professional that has
            always gravitated toward roles where I got to solve the toughest
            problems while collaborating with internal stakeholders and
            customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've worked in tech for eight years in both Research and Development
            and Professional Services. I have a degree in Business and Science
            so I'm equal parts logical problem-solver and relationship builder.
            Last year I completed my diploma in Software Engineering and the
            learning only continues!
          </p>

          <p>
            My work contract ended in March 2024 and as a result I'm looking for
            a role where I can combine my communication and critical thinking
            skills, with my varied technical and programming skills.
